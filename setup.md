### Updating iPython to version 5.0 in your CAE account

Before we start today's lesson we'll need to make sure your CAE account is using
Version 5.0 of the iPython interpreter. To make sure this is the case, type the
following command into your terminal.

~~~
$ pip install --user ipython==5.0
~~~
{: .bash}

Once this update process is complete, run the following command to make sure the
iPython version has been updated.

~~~
$ ipython --version
~~~
{: .bash}

If your iPython version has been properly updated, then you should see this output
after running that command.

~~~
5.0.0
~~~
{: .bash}

If you do not see this number appear, please use your name tag or sticky notes to get
assistance from an instructor or helper.
