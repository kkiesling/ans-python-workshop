The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this
introduction to [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is
built around a common scientific task: data analysis.  Our real goal isn't to
teach you Python, but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming
depends on. We use Python in our lessons because:

1. we have to use *something* for examples;
2. it's well-documented;
3. it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists in academia and industry; and
4. it has a large library of packages available for performing diverse tasks.

But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues
are using, so that you can share your work with them easily, and to use that
language *well*.
