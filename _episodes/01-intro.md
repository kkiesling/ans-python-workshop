Before we can dive into programming, we need to know a little about the MATLAB interface.
Using the default setup, the MATLAB desktop contains several important sections:

* The **Directory** toolbar indicates where we're working on our filesystem.
This indicates where plots, scripts, etc. will be saved.

* **Search Documentation** on the top right of your screen lets you search for functions.
Suggestions for functions that would do what you want to do will pop up.
Clicking on them will open the documentation.

* In the **Command Window** we can run and debug our code. Everything that's entered into the command window is executed immediately. We'll be spending most of our time in the **Command Window** entering commands into MATLAB's interpreter.

* Alternatively, we can open the **Editor**, write our code and run it all at once.
The upside of this is that
we can save our code and run it again in the same way at a later stage. We'll learn more about this later.

* The **Workspace** contains all variable names and assigned values that we currently work with.
  As long as they pop up in the workspace, they are universally available.

We'll be learning more about variables, scripts, and functions in the coming lessons.
